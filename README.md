# Neural Machine Translation

<h2>About</h2>

This is a *SMALL* neural machine translation application that can translate from Enlgish to Russian.

To solve the problem of neural machine translation, I used seq2seq recurrent neural network architecture and pre-trained word embeddings([GloVe])(https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/). This project implements everything from downloading / preparing data to launching an application on a user's sentence. The network has been trained in 20,000 pairs of phrases over 30 epochs.

The purpose of this project is not to make as optimized and computationally effective translation application as possible.
The main goal of the project is to get some experience in building translation-applications and understand seq2seq architecure
of recurrent neural network better.

**Learning and having FUN!**
